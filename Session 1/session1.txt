Firstly I created the main directory using command mkdir and for creating it including space in the name I used double quotes
I changed the working directory using command cd 
I created the new subdirectory using command mkdir and changed the work dircetory to it using cd
Then created the 3 files using touch command and put spaces between each file name to create it at the same time
Finally used ls command to verfity the presence of the files
Used command cd .. to return to the main directory then created a hidden file using touch and put . before file name to be hidden
Finally used ls command to verfity that it is hidden then used ls -a to verfity its presence 
Changed the directory to Documents directory using cd then used nano text editor to write the short message
Saved the message using ctrl + x then clicking Y to save 
Finally used command cat command display the message
Returned again to Documents directory using cd command
Created the new dirctory using mkdir command and put the name in double quotes because it is a special character
Then used command cd and give it the absolute path to enter the directory
Returned back to the main directory using command cd .. twice 
Copied the Documents directory using command cp -r command and give it the new name
Finally I verfied its presence using ls command
Used less command for displaying the content of the hidden file
Returned to Documents directory using cd then started to move files using mv command and give it the absolute path for the new destination 
Finally returned to the main directory using command cd .. and used ls command to verfiy that the files were moved 
Lastly I used rm -rf command to remove the main directory and checked its removal using ls command

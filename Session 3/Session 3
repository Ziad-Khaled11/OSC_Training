First used adduser command to create a new user osc
used passwd command to add a password for the user
used addgroup command to create new group
used command sudo usermod -aG osc_group osc to add osc to the new group
used command sudo usermod -aG sudo osc to grant privileges to the user
used command su to switch user
created new directory using mkdir command
then created the three files using touch command 
changed every file permissions using chmod command
changed the owner of the file using command chown
and changed the group using command chgrp
put & in the end of the command to run in the background
then used the pid and command kill to kill the running process
opened vim and suspended it using ctrl + z
kiled the process using command killall -s KILL vim
used command ps to check that the 2 processes are killed 
used command sudo apt install neofetch to install neofetch
used command sudo apt remove neofetch to delete it
small note 
( in the terminal I installed firefox package and deleted it because neofetch failed to be downloaded and I tried many
times and aked the support so in the end it is the same command but different package )
